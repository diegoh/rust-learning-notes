# Objects Mutability & Behaviour

There is no concept of _inheritance_ in Rust. Instead of _inheritance_ we find _composition_, also known as _composite reuse principle_. This has the potential to provide a high degree of flexibility.

## Composite Reuse Principle

Classes should achieve polymorphic behaviour and code reuse by composition; by containing instances of other classes that implement functionality rather than inheriting the functionality from a _parent_ or _base class_.

## Traits

In Rust it is recommended to create _traits_ to implement [shared] behaviour.

They are used to implement shared behaviour. They are similar to _interfaces_ and even _abstract classes_ in other languages.

A `struct` implements `traits` in Rust.

They're also known as _extension traits_.

## Struct & Impl

In other languages like C# or Java, properties and methods are stored within the single construct of a class. In Rust properties and methods are split into:

- `struct`: Properties
- `impl`: Methods

```rust
struct Door {
  is_open: bool;
}

impl Door {
  fn new(is_open: bool) -> Door {
    Door { is_open: is_open }
  }
}

trait Openable {
  fn open(&mut self);
}

impl Openable for Door {
  fn open(&mut self) {
    self.is_open = true;
  }
}
```

...

```rust
fn open_door() {
  let is_door_open: bool = false;
  let mut door = Door::new(is_door_open);
  door.open();
  assert!(door.is_open);
}
```
