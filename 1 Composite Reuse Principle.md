# Composite Reuse Principle

There is no concept of _inheritance_ in Rust. Instead of _inheritance_ we find _composition_, also known as _composite reuse principle_. This has the potential to provide a high degree of flexibility.

Classes should achieve polymorphic behaviour and code reuse by composition; by containing instances of other classes that implement functionality rather than inheriting the functionality from a _parent_ or _base class_.
