# Ownership

Rust replaces runtime garbage collection with compile-time checks for memory safety.

Ownership and Borrowing are the reasons why Rust can work without a garbage collector. This makes things simpler for the developer using the language.

In a high level, the compiler inserts any `provide x amount of memory` and `remove x amount of memory` similar to `malloc()` and `free()` in C.

Rules of Ownership:

- The owner of a value is a variable
- At any time, only a single owner is allowed
- The value is lost once the owner goes out of scope

```rust
fn example() {

  // Compiler: allocate memory for largo
  let largo = LargeObj::new();
  largo.do_stuff();

  // Compiler: allocate memory for foo
  let foo = another_func();

  if foo > 10 {
    do_a_few_things();
  }
} // de-allocate (drop) largo, foo
```

It is impossible to know the amount of memory necessary for `largo` or `foo` at compile time. Many languages do these checks at runtime. Rust gets around this with two main strategies:

- Every variable is owned by exactly one scope at any time
- The developer is forced to pass ownership as required

There are two areas of memory: The stack and the heap. The developer uses types to decide whether to allocate heap or stack memory.

Stack memory is short lived and smaller. The size of a variable needs to be known before.
